//! If you are using this crate on Linux with Unity support I would recommend to initialize `TaskbarIndicator`
//! at application start because if you application exited without clean its `TaskbarIndicator` the launcher
//! would remember the indicator state when the user opens your app by second time. In that case if you
//! initialize `TaskbarIndicator` your app indicator state will be cleaned.
